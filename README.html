<p>I enjoyed this text editor because:</p>
<ul> 
    <li>Works with ALOT of diffrent other programming languages.</li>
	<li>Something i really likes was their "Auto-recovery" of documents incase of a crash, kill or shutdown</li>
	<li>It is also pretty fast when opening it up.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some things I did not like as much from this editor</p>
<ul>
	<li>What I didnt like about bluefish is that it's not an editor build specifically for html. I worked fine and did what it had to do but Its just not a program where I could see myself choosing over notepad++ or Brackets.
	<li>It supports alot of other diffrent programming languages which I feel is what makes it seem less specific towarrds html, I would rather work with a editor that is specifucally for html if I am only going to be using it for html.</li>
	<li>It was pretty annoying, i didnt like the way it looked or felt, it seemed a little too basic and dull looking.</li>
	<li>I guess the impression I first got from bluefish compared to Brackets is not as great. I really liked brackets and theres alot of things I was looking for in bluefish, something that had me sold in brackets rather than bluefish is the live preview of what it is you're coding. </li>
